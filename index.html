		<p class="lead"> The interactive graph bellow tells us a story, this is the story of how two failed reaction
			wheels accidently
			paved the way for a new area in astronomy. But first a brief overview of what reaction wheels are and how
			they
			operate. In a satellite to turn your craft without expending propellant, you have a wheel attached to an
			electric motor once that wheel spins up it produces enough torque to control which direction the satellite
			is
			pointing. Which, as you can imagine, is a handy tool for a space based telescope. </p>
		<hr class="my-4">
		<p>The Kepler Space telescope was launched as part of the Discovery Program in 2009 with 4 reaction wheels to
			steer
			the craft. It was possible to complete the mission with 3 but it would have made it more difficult. Then in
			July
			2012 Reaction Wheel 2 failed. A short time later in May 2013 the unthinkable happened, reaction wheel 4
			failed
			as well. Meaning that it was effectively only able to turn in 1 direction, severely limiting the Telescopes
			abilityâ€™s, field of view and because of this the telescope could no longer fight the radiation pressure
			(solar
			wind) from the un and would drift aimlessly unable to correct its self. For the next 3 months several
			proposals
			where submitted as for what the next stages of the mission should be. One cleaver researcher came up with
			the
			idea of using the sun as a third reaction wheel, they would turn the telescope so that the radiation
			pressure
			was enough that it didn't need a third wheel and could orient its self to the intended target and not be
			spin
			out of control and be stable enough to get a clear picture. The downside to this is that it only gave
			roughly 4
			viewing windows a year and the telescope would be pointing in the same orientation, but it worked.</p>
		<p class="lead">
			Prior to this Kepler had found 116 planets out of the 938 that where known up until 2013. In May 2014, the
			newly
			named K2 "Second Light" had been announced and had completed its test phases. in the following 7 months
			Kepler
			would go on to discover 815 out of the 928 that where announced that year. 2016 was even more successful.
			Out of
			the 1415 announced exoplanets 1301 where discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope.
