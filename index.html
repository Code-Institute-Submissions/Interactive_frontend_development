		<p class="lead"> The interactive graph bellow tells us a story, this is the story of how two failed reaction
			wheels accidently
			paved the way for a new area in astronomy. But first a brief overview of what reaction wheels are and how
			they
			operate. In a satellite to turn your craft without expending propellant, you have a wheel attached to an
			electric motor once that wheel spins up it produces enough torque to control which direction the satellite
			is
			pointing. Which, as you can imagine, is a handy tool for a space based telescope. </p>
		<hr class="my-4">
		<p>The Kepler Space telescope was launched as part of the Discovery Program in 2009 with 4 reaction wheels to
			steer
			the craft. It was possible to complete the mission with 3 but it would have made it more difficult. Then in
			July
			2012 Reaction Wheel 2 failed. A short time later in May 2013 the unthinkable happened, reaction wheel 4
			failed
			as well. Meaning that it was effectively only able to turn in 1 direction, severely limiting the Telescopes
			ability’s, field of view and because of this the telescope could no longer fight the radiation pressure
			(solar
			wind) from the un and would drift aimlessly unable to correct its self. For the next 3 months several
			proposals
			where submitted as for what the next stages of the mission should be. One cleaver researcher came up with
			the
			idea of using the sun as a third reaction wheel, they would turn the telescope so that the radiation
			pressure
			was enough that it didn't need a third wheel and could orient its self to the intended target and not be
			spin
			out of control and be stable enough to get a clear picture. The downside to this is that it only gave
			roughly 4
			viewing windows a year and the telescope would be pointing in the same orientation, but it worked.</p>
		<p class="lead">
			Prior to this Kepler had found 116 planets out of the 938 that where known up until 2013. In May 2014, the
			newly
			named K2 "Second Light" had been announced and had completed its test phases. in the following 7 months
			Kepler
			would go on to discover 815 out of the 928 that where announced that year. 2016 was even more successful.
			Out of
			the 1415 announced exoplanets 1301 where discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope.

						<p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun
							takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the
							Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.
							<br>
							Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an interior planet, and its
							apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the
							Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern
							horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright
							star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet
							telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it
							moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of
							approximately 116 days. </p>

					<td>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
						As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows
						and, rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and
						so never appears to venture far from the Sun, setting in the west just after dusk and rising in
						the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period
						of 243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any planet in the Solar System
						and rotates in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and
						sets in the east). Venus does not have any natural satellites, a distinction it shares only with
						Mercury among planets in the Solar System.</td>

				<tr>
					<td><img src="static/css/photo/planets/Earth.jpg" alt="Earth" srcset=""></td>
					<td>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
						According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion
						years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the
						Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days, a
						period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about
						366.256 times.
						<br>
						Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on
						Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's
						orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the
						Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.</td>

					<td><img src="static/css/photo/planets/Mars.jpg" alt="Mars" srcset=""></td>
					<td>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after
						Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the
						'Red Planet'. The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface,
						which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the
						naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features
						reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps
						of Earth.</td>

				<tr>
					<td><img src="static/css/photo/planets/Jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter" srcset=""></td>
					<td>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant
						with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other
						planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the
						naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded
						history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright
						enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and is on average the third-brightest natural
						object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.</td>

				<tr>
					<td><img src="static/css/photo/planets/Saturn.jpg" alt="Saturn" srcset=""></td>
					<td>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after
						Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has
						only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95
						times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture;
						its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><img src="static/css/photo/planets/Uranus.jpg" alt="Uranus" srcset=""></td>
					<td>Uranus (from the Latin name Ūranus for the Greek god Οὐρανός) is the seventh planet from the
						Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar
						System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions
						which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists
						often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants.
						Uranus' atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen
						and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces
						of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a
						minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with
						water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The
						interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.</td>

				<tr>
					<td><img src="static/css/photo/planets/Neptune.jpg" alt="Neptune" srcset=""></td>
					<td>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar
						System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the
						densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its
						near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass
						causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8
						years at an average distance of 30.1 au (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the
						Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's
						trident.</td>
