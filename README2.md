# Interactive Frontend Development
<i>Interactive Front end development Project Milestone. </i>

<p>
My Milestone project is an interactive dashboard bassed off a dataset that was retrieved from Kaggle.

From the moment I started this module I Knew that this is the project that I was going to do.
The potentional of svg to minuplate large volumes of meaningless strings of letters and numbers and turn it into functional,
interesting and interactive charts and diagrams is virtually unlimited from my point of view. Where upon the click of the mouse you can filter one chart
and the rest follows suit and amends themselves to recalcaluate their own values lends it's self more to magic than computer science.
So, naturally, I set out to find exactly how this worked and the things that could be done.

For this I picked a subject that I know a little bit about and now all I needed was a dataset to match.
My goal was to find a dataset of either exoplanets (planets outsite out solar system) or a dataset of known stars and arange the graphs arround the data.
I had intended on getting my wireframes and my questions prepaired before I got the dataset but I soon realised that I may not get to answer all of my questions with the one dataset.

I soon scrapped that idea and draw up a plan starting with the end goal and working backwards with each step telling me what I needed to get and what I needed to do to to get there.

I started with:

<ul>

<li>My End Goal - 
Responsive charts/graphs</li>
<li>To get there I needed
formulas and functions and place holders for the graphs in my code</li>
<li>which needed
a wireframe mock up of my design to sugest where everything was going to go</li>
<li>which relys on
questions that I needed data to answer</li>
<li>to answer those questions I found
a plantary csv dataset</li>

</ul>
Which gave me a plan of action to incramentally achieve my goal by setting a small steps that I can easily follow.

    So, I found my start point, I needed a dataset. I had looked at 3 different datasets all of which can be found on Kaggle.com,
    "Open ExoPlanet Catalogue" by Megan Risdal, "ExoPlanets database" by Eduardo Wojcikiewicz  and "Kepeler ExoPlanet Search Results" By NASA. I ended up going with the 
    "Open ExoPlanet Catalogue" by Megan Risdal, due to the fact that it was the most complete cataloge, it had all the data points that i needed to answer all my questions.

    The next step I needed to do was to get the questions that I neeed to answer. I had a number of questions that I wanted to answer. Naturaly there were some that I had to cut
    because of time constraints, namely, "Distance/Year discovered" where it would show that it would show a direct correlaction between how fara away was with the star and 
    when it was discovered, "distance/star temprature" where it would show that the hotter and therefore brighter the star the harder it is to spot planets arround it.
    I setteled on "What are the names of the Planets Discovered so far?", "How where the planets caragorised? IE confirmed planets, non-confirmed ect", 
    "how many planets where discovered each year?", "By what method were each planets discovered?" and "How many Records are being displayed at any time?"

    With the list of Questions i could then decied on what graph and what order the graph would be shown. When I had made my Wireframe I had not elimenated any questions so some of my
    origional questions where in there as this was still at the design stage of my project. For my wireframe I chose a site called MockFlow.com. They alloud me to create a free wire frame 
    for free on their platform (click <a href="https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/Me16e59cd288f0d779d96c6aa41a089101569756313907" target="_blank">Here</a> to view)

    Now for the final 10% of my project that takes up 90% of the time and knowledge. The actual coding. I used a number of Libraries to help with my project, Bootstrap for the style and Colours
    D3 and DC to create the graphs, kaggle for the data, queue.js crossfilter and jquery. I also wrote
