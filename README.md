# Interactive Frontend Development
<i>Interactive Front end development Project Milestone. </i>

<p>
My Milestone project is an interactive dashboard bassed off a dataset that was retrieved from Kaggle.

From the moment I started this module I Knew that this is the project that I was going to do.
The potentional of svg to minuplate large volumes of meaningless strings of letters and numbers and turn it into functional,
interesting and interactive charts and diagrams is virtually unlimited from my point of view. Where upon the click of the mouse you can filter one chart
and the rest follows suit and amends themselves to recalcaluate their own values lends it's self more to magic than computer science.
So, naturally, I set out to find exactly how this worked and the things that could be done.

For this I picked a subject that i know a little bit about and now all I needed was a dataset to match.
My goal was to find a dataset of either exoplanets (planets outsite out solar system) or a dataset of known stars and arange the graphs arround the data.
I had intended on getting my wireframes and my questions prepaired before i got the dataset but i soon realised that i may not get to answer all of my questions with the one dataset.

I soon scrapped that idea and draw up a plan starting with the end goal and working backwards with each step telling me what i needed to do to to get there.

I started with:

My End Goal;
<i>Responsive charts/graphs</i>
to get there i needed
<i>formulas and functions and place holde5rs for the graphs in my code<i/>
which needed
<i>a wireframe mock up of my design to sugest where everything was going to go</i>
which relys on
<i>questions that I needed the data to answer</i>
to answer those questions i got
<i>a plantary csv dataset</i>

Which gave me a plan of action to incramentally achieve my goal by setting a small steps that I can easily follow.
